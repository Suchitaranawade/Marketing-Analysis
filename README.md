ðŸŸ¦ Title: Hotel GTM Analysis


"Hi everyone, Iâ€™m Suchita Ranawade. Today, Iâ€™ll present a brief analysis of guest feedback for our newly launched hotel located in a popular scenic destination.
The purpose is to understand how well weâ€™re meeting customer expectations and what we can improve to deliver a better guest experience."

ðŸŸ¦ What Guests Expect vs. What They Experience


"We surveyed guests at both check-in and check-out. At check-in, they told us what influenced their decision to book. At check-out, they shared what they actually liked.
Out of 47 guests, more than half expected clean rooms, a good breakfast, and fast Wi-Fi.
We performed well on Wi-Fi and quiet ambianceâ€”81% and 89% satisfaction.
However, only 38% were satisfied with room cleanliness, and just 62% with breakfast.
These gaps show where weâ€™re falling short."

ðŸŸ¦ Marketing vs. Reality


"Our marketing is workingâ€”guests remember the features we promote. But in many cases, their experience doesnâ€™t match the promise.
Clean and comfortable rooms, fitness facilities, and breakfast are key areas where weâ€™ve created high expectations, but delivered less.
This misalignment can cause disappointment and lead to poor reviews and lost trust."

ðŸŸ¦ Management Recommendations


"Hereâ€™s a four-part plan to improve the guest experience:

Fix operational issues: Improve room cleanliness, review breakfast quality, and check fitness facility upkeep.

Reposition marketing: Emphasize features we do wellâ€”like Wi-Fi and peaceful environmentâ€”and be honest about whatâ€™s still being improved.

Train and align staff: Connect employee goals with guest satisfaction and empower staff to resolve issues quickly.

Track progress: Use short, post-stay surveys and a dashboard to monitor guest feedback regularly."

ðŸŸ¦ Conclusion


"In summary, weâ€™ve identified clear gaps between whatâ€™s promised and whatâ€™s delivered.
By improving operations, adjusting our messaging, and staying in tune with guest feedback, we can build a stronger, more trusted guest experience. Thank you!"
